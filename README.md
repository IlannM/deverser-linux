# DÃ©verser-linux
Original script by @moski_dev. If you are using Mac this script with the folling procedure should also, but this is targeted to linux machines.\
[Here's the original repo](https://github.com/MatthewPierson/deverser), go there to know what the hell this is about.
## Requirements
On your PC/Mac:

- `iproxy`\
install it if you haven't already.\
Debian/Ubuntu:\
`sudo apt install libusbmuxd-tools`\
MacOS: ([brew](brew.sh) required)\
`brew install libimobiledevice`

- `img4tool`\
download it [here](https://github.com/tihmstar/img4tool/releases/tag/197)\
extract it.\
"install" the binary\
`sudo cp buildroot_ubuntu-latest/usr/local/bin/img4tool /usr/local/bin/img4tool`\
On your idevice:
- `OpenSSH`\
Install it with your package manager.
## Before running the script
Start `iproxy` in the background:\
`iproxy 2222 22 > /dev/null &`\
Change the script permisions to run it:\
`chmod +x ./deverser-linux.sh`\
## Now we are good to run the script
`./deverser-linux.sh`\
if you did everything correctly, you should have a .shsh2 file in your folder.
